        <h3>EverUse</h3>
        <p>At Everuse, we collaborate with gyms, retailers, and manufacturers in the climbing industry to transform used climbing ropes into premium, eco-friendly products. Our mission is twofold: to reduce waste and extend the lifespan of climbing ropes, while also minimizing the ecological footprint of the climbing industry.</p>
        <p>By offering sustainable solutions, we aspire to become the preferred brand for climbers who are deeply committed to their sport and the environment. Additionally, we are dedicated to forging partnerships and providing financial support to organizations that are actively engaged in preserving access, restoring climbing areas, and enhancing safety in the climbing community. Behind the scenes, our backend application operates as an API built using the robust Rails framework and a PostgreSQL database. </p>
        <p>This API features a single endpoint powered by GraphQL (/graphql), responsible for handling incoming requests, querying our internal database, and delivering formatted JSON responses to the frontend application.</p>
